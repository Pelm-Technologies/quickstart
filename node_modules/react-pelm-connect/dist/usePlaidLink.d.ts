 * This hook loads Plaid script and manages the Plaid Link creation for you.
 * You get easy open & exit methods to call and loading & error states.
 *
 * This will destroy the Plaid UI on un-mounting so it's up to you to be
 * graceful to the user.
 *
 * A new Plaid instance is created every time the token and products options change.
 * It's up to you to prevent unnecessary re-creations on re-render.
